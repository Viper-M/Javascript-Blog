function:
to create a function first we have to declare “function” keyword then we gave a function name then we gave one or more parameter as we need if we don’t need any parameter we can keep it empty then then we declare its body by {}. there are another function called arrow function.
variable:
variables are normally used to prevent same things again and again.it can be declare by var, let, const. let variables are used when there is chance to change its value. if there is no chance of changing any value, we can use const. and var can be used in every situation.
Array:
in javascript array is a special variable which can hold more value at a time.Usually array is declared by []. example, const friends = [“Rahat”, “Sakib”, “Tanvir”]. here friends is a array.
object:
object is also a variable which can hold many value. in object values are declare as name: value. such as const pen = { color: “white”, price: 5}.
.slice():
slice() method is used to get a new array without modifying the original array. it works by index number. you will have to give two value one is from which index its start to slice and another is where it will end.
.push():
if someone needs to add an element in last of an array he can try push() method to add an element in last of an array.
.pop():
this method is totally opposite of push method. when you needs to delete or remove an element form the last of the array you must try this pop() method
.map():
this is one of the very helpful method of javascript. this method can gives you every element from an array by loop throwing.
ternary operator:
this is the easiest way you can apply a condition. in ternary operator true parts of a condition take place before “?” this symbol and false part will take place after“:” this symbol.
math.floor():
